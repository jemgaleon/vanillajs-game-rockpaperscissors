# Rock, Paper and Scissors Javascript Game

Came accross to [Dev Ed](https://t.co/tUOTpx1oZG?amp=1)'s videos on YouTube, and tried out his rock, paper, and scissors [awesome tutorial](https://youtu.be/qWPtKtYEsN4) written in JavaScript. I've made some tweaks, check it out.

.. maybe we can do "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock"? Lol
